# Denpendency & Environment
We recommend using a docker container to run our code, but we still provide a way to configure the environment without docker.

## Run TMT with docker
First install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository) following the instructions linked. Once you have this installed, download and start our container using the following command:
```bash
# download image from docker hub.

# start container.

# run container.

```

## Run TMT without docker
