##  Introduction
We introduce a method for assigning photorealistic relightable materials
to 3D shapes in an automatic manner. Our method takes as input a photo
exemplar of a real object and a 3D object with segmentation, and uses the
exemplar to guide the assignment of materials to the parts of the shape, so
that the appearance of the resulting shape is as similar as possible to the
exemplar. 

For more details and materials, please refer to our [[project page](https://vcc.tech/research/2022/TMT)].

## Getting started
For all users, please read **dependency** for initial environment setting. Then, for users who want to just use our pre-trained model, please read **material translation**. And for users who want to re-train models with their own data, please read **data pre-process** for more help. 

Enjoy it!ðŸ˜Ž
